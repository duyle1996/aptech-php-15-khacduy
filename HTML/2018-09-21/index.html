        <p class="parph">Our goal with MacBook was to do the impossible: engineer a full‑size experience into the thinnest, lightest Mac notebook yet. And not only is it compact — it’s more powerful than ever. The new MacBook delivers up to 20 percent faster performance with new seventh‑generation Intel Core m3, i5, and i7 processors,1 and up to 50 percent faster SSD storage.2</p>

              <hr>
              <p>We believe that a comfortable, full-size keyboard is an essential part of any notebook. To fit one into MacBook, we designed a keyboard from the ground up — including each key and its underlying mechanism. This makes the whole keyboard not only much thinner, but also more comfortable and precise, so your fingers feel right at home.

                <p>MacBook takes full advantage of the latest 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 wireless technologies — and with innovative Apple software and services that let you get the most out of them, you can wirelessly connect to the web, transfer files, organize your photos, listen to music, and more.</p>

                <p>With powerful technologies in an incredibly compact enclosure, MacBook is designed to fit perfectly into a world where just about anything you do with a notebook can be done over the air. For those moments when you do need to plug in, USB-C packs a ton of capability into one small and convenient port.</p>
